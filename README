MoneyPenny
MoneyPenny is a homebanking program based on the German HBCI standard.
HBCI is supported by roughly 90% of the German banks.
Moneypenny supports HBCI 2.0.1, 2.1 and 2.2 with or without chipcard (RDH or DDV procedures). 
PIN TAN and HBCI PIN TAN are not supported. If you want to use MoneyPenny, your
bank has to support HBCI (which is very unlikely outside Germany) and you have to 
apply for an HBCI access to your accounts.
Many servers that offer HBCI 2.0.1 only, suffer from a poor implementation. 
The first really stable HBCI vesrion is 2.1

See INSTALL for documentation on how to install the program.
MoneyPenny is released under the GPL licence.
You are encouraged to copy the program, look into the sources, 
and use the ideas in there for your own programs.
Enjoy!
